<!-- The main index.html file is the initial page loaded by the browser that kicks everything off. 
The Angular CLI (with Webpack under the hood) bundles all of the compiled javascript files 
together and injects them into the body of the index.html page so the scripts can be loaded 
and executed by the browser. -->
